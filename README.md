# Dinosaur-Fosil-Record-Insights
This project involved analyzing Dinosaur Fossil Record Data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). I leveraged Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. I handled missing data, generated visualizations, and analyzed trends over time to extract meaningful insights. My analysis focused on exploring dinosaur diversity, identifying the prevalence of specific types, determining the largest-bodied species, and evaluating a hypothesis regarding the evolutionary increase in dinosaur size.
